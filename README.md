# 112-Final-Project
My group recreated the classic game, Frogger, for our final project!

Setup: 
1) Download the pictures zip file and unzip it. 
2) Download the Frogger.java file into the resulting pictures folder. 

Objective:
Get to the top of the screen while avoiding the cars and water!

How to play:
1) Use WASD to move.
2) One button click corresponds to one movement. Do not hold down a given key
to move faster. 
3) Hop onto the moving logs to avoid falling into the water.
